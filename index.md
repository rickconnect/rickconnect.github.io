## Welcome to RickConnect.github.io

Hello, 

My name is RA. I am an SDET (Software Development Engineer in Test).
Software development, testing(all kinds), Azure management, CI/CD, low-level debugging, and build engineering.
My resume is here:

This repo is home to a couple of my Azure C# projects.
1. [Wiki of Things](https://github.com/rickconnect/rickconnect.github.io/wiki)
2. [Azure Blob Monitor](https://github.com/rickconnect)
3. [Azure Blob Downloader](https://github.com/rickconnect)




You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/rickconnect/rickconnect.github.io/edit/main/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/rickconnect/rickconnect.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
